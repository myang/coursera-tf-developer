## Image Augmentation
It's about adding variants of a small image dataset by rotating, shifting, shearing and mirroring of the images in the memory.
## Overfitting
Randomizing the training and testing images is a way to reduce overfitting.
## increase epochs (e.g. from 2 to 30) can increase accuracy from (0.59, 0.62) to (0.73, 0.75).
