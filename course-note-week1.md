Get to know the instructor Laurence Moroney, a Google AI advocate who has published more than 30 [books](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/entity/author/B001ILFKMS?_encoding=UTF8&node=283155&offset=0&pageSize=12&searchAlias=stripbooks&sort=date-desc-rank&page=1&langFilter=default#formatSelectorHeader).
The first week content takes about 5 hours. I learned basic ML workflow by a Hello-World like example. 

There are two main ML frameworks: PyTorch (by Facebook) and Keras/TensorFlow. PyTorch is pure Python and good for PoC and research; Keras is Python on top of TensorFlow which is built for production from the beginning. Other cool features I value are:
* handy visualization tool called [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard);
* [Swift for TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift). Swift is my favorite language I am currently learning;
* [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) for inference on mobile phone;
* [TinyML](https://tinyml.org) for MCU;
* [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/), LLVM IR support for Machine Learing;
* [ARM-NN](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/machine-learning/arm-nn?_ga=2.61692140.1350605489.1602529484-1666769015.1602014530), low-level APIs supporting TensorFlow for heterogeous ARM architecture acrossing Android, RTOS.
